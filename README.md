# Vector Graphics Conversion System

### Introduction
- I have a deep confusion about many paid vector conversion platforms—why do we need to pay to download? When I wanted to use icons for my own web pages, the free conversion platforms couldn’t make the PNG images usable, and the platforms that could convert them required payment. So, I wrote a script to solve this problem myself. That should have been the end of it, but I enjoyed the convenience brought by the open-source spirit, so I decided to open-source this script as well.

### Future
- This project will continue to be updated. In the future, I hope to make it a free tool that can convert to any format, so stay tuned...
